/*
Create a class called OxygenTank. You are diving in the ocean. Your oxygen tank has a certain level (number) and you
must print a message based on the level:
                                           Above 90 -  Your tank is full
                                           Above 80 -  Still okay
                                           Above 70 -  Don't go too far
                                           Above 60 -  Start to head back
                                           Above 50 -  Be careful now you at at 50%

USE ONE PRINT STATEMENT ONLY
